# xtea
Verilog implementation of the xtea block cipher.

## Status
Not done. Does NOT work.


## Introduction
[Xtea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA) is a compact, Feistel based
block cipher designed by Wheeler and Needham in 1997. It has a 64 bit
block and 128 bit key. It has a very simple key scheme but many rounds.

I've implemented it in hardware before, but never released a version
with open license. Time to change that.
